# Text-to-image-synthesis-with-GANs

#### Python 3.7+ and Pytorch 1.x

#### Play with this model: [Demo Link](https://share.streamlit.io/gladiator07/text-to-image-synthesis-with-attngan/main/app.py)

## About the project
A **PyTorch** re-implementation of the paper **AttnGAN**: Fine-Grained Text to Image Generation with Attentional Generative Adversarial Networks, which was released on 28 November 2017. Please refer to the streamlit web-app to see the demo and explanation of this article.

### Sneak-peek into the webapp
